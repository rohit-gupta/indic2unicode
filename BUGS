Surekh Font:

1. Currently LokSabha uses a wrong Surekh character for showing MATRA_I when it is used on a consonant preceded by a half-consonent. As a result the MATRA_I does not fall in the right unicode sequence. It seems that the software used for transcribing parliamentary debates is itself buggy.
